    "detail": "Been to many different festivals in my time but Glastonbury Festival is by far the best, and not just because its local! The people, the vibe, the atmosphere - it's five days of heaven. There's ALWAYS something to do and something to see, no matter what your taste. Always something new to discover. If you're a festival person, I cannot recommend enough!",
